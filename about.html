           <h3>Bio</h3>
      <center><p> Hi my name is Shawn. See the sweat on my brow! Sewing is a workout. I wrestle with fabric and I run with scissors. Though that's about the only thing i run with. I do, however, run Tudah Mae'd It. I started this company after my military service in the Army. Fun with fabric is my motto. I love to create and share my experiences with you through sewing.</p></center>

          <h3>Faves</h3>
     <center><p>One of my favorite things is great quality materials. I love working with products that wear well. I enjoy perfecting my craft. There is a difference between handmade and homemade. Both are from the heart but handmade goods that are sold should always feature quality workmanship. Beautifully stitched and well constructed goods are what we strive for.</p></center>
